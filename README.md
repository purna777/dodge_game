Welcome to the introduction to PyGame and Python 3 video game programming!

Suggested Requirements for this series

You may wish to be familiar with the basics of the Python 3 programming language, or at least the basics of Programming in general

That said, this course begins at a slowish pace, and I do my best to explain everything at least the first time it shows up. PyGame can actually be a wonderful starting place for your journey in Python.



Game creation in any programming language is very rewarding, and also makes for a great teaching tool. With game development, you often have quite a bit of logic, mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence, and other things, all of which come together for game creation. Not only this, but the topic is games, so it can be very fun.

Many times people like to visualize the programs they are creating, as it can help people to learn programming logic quickly. Games are fantastic for this, as your are specifically programming everything you see.
